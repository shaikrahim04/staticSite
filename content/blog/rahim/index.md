# About Me

Hello! My name is Abdulrahim. I am currently pursuing my B.Tech in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I am passionate about computer vision and natural language processing.

I enjoy building tools and projects that are useful, make an impact, or simply make me happy. I am eager to learn, grow, and share knowledge with others. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new ideas, reading, or working on personal projects.

Thanks for visiting my blog!
